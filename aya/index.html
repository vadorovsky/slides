          ## About me
          * Michal Rostecki
          * vadorovsky @ Github, Discord, Matrix etc.
          * Software Engineer @ Deepfence Inc
          * Rustacean with Go, C and Python background
          ---
          ## What is eBPF?
          * Technology which runs sandboxed programs in an operating system kernel.
          * Event-driven, triggered by events in the kernel, receiving pointers to kernel or userspace memory.
          * No need to modify kernel code or load kernel modules. eBPF programs can be just loaded and run.

          ---
          ## What events?
          * kernel function calls
            * or [tracepoints](https://docs.kernel.org/trace/tracepoints.html)
          * userspace function calls
          * network packets
          * messages on sockets
          * actions which trigger [LSM hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules)
            * filesystem operations
            * allocating and freeing processes
            * changing the user identity
          ---
          ## BPF program types
          * For each type of events there is a separate type of program.
          * Examples:
            * **KProbe** (or **FEntry**) - for kernel function tracing
            * **UProbe** - for userspace function tracing
            * **Classifier** - for network packet inspection (sk_buff)
            * **XDP** - for network packet inspection (raw packet on NIC)
            * **LSM** - for security policies
          * Each type has its own requirement of kernel version.
          ---
          ## BPF maps
          * Storage for sharing data between eBPF programs (in kernel) and userspace.
          * Different types:
            * hash maps
            * arrays
            * perf buffers (buffers for pushing events to userspace)
          * Can be available in BPFFS (`/sys/fs/bpf`)
          ---

          ---
          ## Lifetime of a BPF program
          * BPF programs have **links** - they are attached to events.
          * By default, links are dropped when the `Bpf` object in the userspace project is dropped.
          * You can detach the links earlier if you want.
          * TODO: support link persistence by pinning in BPFFS (it's possible in libbpf)
          ---
          ## Examples of BPF projects
          * Cilium - CNI plugin, Kubernetes networking, service mesh
          * Katran - L4 load balancer
          * Tracee - application tracing tool
          * Falco - security monitoring for containers
          ---
          ---
          ## eBPF project layout
          * **userspace program**: loading eBPF programs to the kernel
          * **eBPF programs**: running in the kernel and reacting to events
          ---
          ## "Official" ways to use eBPF
          * **bpftrace**: very easy, own scripting language
          * **libbpf**: umm... not easy at all (everything in C)
          * **libbpf-rs**: easier (eBPF programs in C, userspace program in Rust)
          * **bcc**: easier (eBPF programs in C,)
          ---
          ## What's so hard about libbpf?
          * Everything written in C.
          * Official docs are limited. Fragmented information in multiple websites and blogs.
          * Necessity to create custom Makefile, write boilerplate code.
          * There is a [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap), but it requires a lot of manual tweaking.
          * No logging. You can use `bpf_printk`, but you shouldn't. Logging is usually implemented from scratch in each project.
          ---
          ## Why Aya?
          * Everything in Rust, also eBPF programs!
          * rustup, rustc and cargo is all you need. No additional libs or tools.
          * One central [book/documentation](https://aya-rs.github.io/book/).
          * [Template](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya-template) ready to use with `cargo generate`.
          ---
          ## Why Rust?
          * Using language features like `Result`, `Option`.
          * Static linking and portable binaries.
          * You can keep both eBPF and userspace part in one language.
            * And share the structures.
          ---
          ## Memory safety?
          * Actually... Rust memory model doesn't matter that much on eBPF part.
          * eBPF has access to kernel and userspace memory via pointers, which are unsafe.
          * Memory safety relies more on the eBPF verifier in the kernel rather than Rust compiler.

          ## How to start with Aya?
          ```bash
          rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src
          cargo install bpf-linker
          cargo install cargo-generate
          ```
          ---
          ## Starting a new project
          ```bash
          cargo generate https://github.com/aya-rs/aya-template
          ```
          ---
          ## Running the project
          ```bash
          cargo xtask run
          ```
          Only building:
          ```bash
          cargo xtask build-ebpf
          cargo build
          ```
