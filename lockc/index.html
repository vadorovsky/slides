          ## Container security
          * Kubernetes security is showing great progress...
          * ...though it's done mostly on API and image scanning level.
          * But what about container runtimes and kernel?
          ---
          ## eBPF
          * Technology which runs sandboxed programs in the OS kernel, event-driven.
          * It's widely used for observability (system events, network) and detecting malicious behavior.
          * But what about preventing it?
          ---
          ## Linux Security Modules (LSM)
          * Framework in the Linux kernel, a basis for security systems (SELinux, Apparmor).
          * Consists of various hooks for actions which have security considerations.
          * Developers can use those hooks to make decisions (whether the action is allowed).
          * Usually used in kernel modules, but...
          ---
          ## eBPF LSM
          * Since Linux 5.7, LSM can be used in eBPF programs.
          * No need for loading modules or modifying kernel code!
          * You can write your userspace control plane interacting with LSM subsystem.
          ---
          ## lockc
          * Uses eBPF LSM to harden containers.
          * Written in Rust, using [Aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya).
          * Detects runc processes, then tracks their children, enforcing policies on them.
          * For now - predefined policies, inspired by Pod Security Admission Controller.
          * Proof of concept, not meant for production.
          ---
          ## How that works?
          * lockc userpsace agent monitors every new `runc` process.
          * It's aware what's running the container (Kubernetes or Docker), a
            policy level is applied based on that.
          * Container ID, runc PID and policy level are saved in BPF maps.
          * BPF program is tracking all the children scheduled inside container.
          * Other BPF programs are enforcing policies on all those processes.
          ---
          ## What's enforced now?
          * Bind mounts
          * What files can be accessed (i.e. `/sys/fs` is hidden)
          * Access to kernel syslog
          * User ID
          ---
          ## Future
          * Allowing to execute only specific binaries (CMD/ENTRYPOINT + few essentials).
          * Make the most of container FS read-only, guarantee immutability of binaries.
          * Supporting more runtimes (youki, crun), engines (Docker, nerdctl), CRI (cri-o).
          * eBPF LSM attached to cgroups.
          * Custom policies? Providing a policy language?
