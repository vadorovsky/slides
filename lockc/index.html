          ## Container security
          * Kubernetes security is showing great progress...
          * ...though it's done mostly on API level.
          * But what about container runtimes and kernel?
          ---
          ## eBPF
          * Technology which runs sandboxed programs in the OS kernel.
          * It's widely used for observability and detecting malicious behavior.
          * But what about preventing it?
          ---
          ## Linux Security Modules (LSM)
          * Framework in the Linux kernel, a basis for security systems (SELinux, Apparmor).
          * Consists of various hooks for actions which have security considerations.
          * Developers can use those hooks to make decisions (whether the action is allowed).
          * Usually used in kernel modules, but...
          ---
          ## eBPF LSM
          * Since Linux 5.7, LSM can be used in eBPF programs.
          * No need for loading modules or modifying kernel code.
          ---
          ## Container security again...
          * Good practices which are not enforced:
            * Not running as root.
            * Not allowing to execute random binaries.
          * Containers leak information about the host:
            * `/sys/fs` is not namespaced.
          ---
          ## lockc
          * Uses eBPF LSM to harden containers.
          * Written in Rust, using [Aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya).
          * Detects runc processes, then tracks their children, enforcing policies on them.
          * For now - predefined policies, inspired by Pod Security Admission Controller.
          * Proof of concept, not meant for production.
          ---
          ## Future
          * Supporting more runtimes (youki, crun) and engines (cri-o).
          * eBPF LSM attached to cgroups.
          * Custom policies? Providing a policy language?
